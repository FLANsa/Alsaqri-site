# 🚀 Deployment Guide for Mobile Phone Inventory System

## Current Issue: Pillow Installation Failed

The deployment is failing because of Pillow compatibility issues with Python 3.13.4 on Render.

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### Option 1: Use Updated Requirements (Recommended)
Replace your `requirements.txt` with the updated version that uses:
- `Pillow>=10.1.0` (more compatible)
- `python-3.11.7` (more stable)

### Option 2: Alternative Requirements File
Use `requirements-deploy.txt` instead of `requirements.txt` for deployment.

## 📋 Deployment Steps for Render

### 1. Update Your Repository
```bash
# Commit the updated files
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment requirements"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Configure Render Deployment
- Go to your Render dashboard
- Select your service
- Go to "Environment" tab
- Set these environment variables:
  ```
  PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.7
  ```

### 3. Alternative: Use Railway Instead
Railway often has better compatibility:
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Deploy automatically
